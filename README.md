## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

The default configuration uses a local server for development. To use a different server, set the `VITE_COLLABJAM_SERVERS` environment variable. Therefore, create a `.env` file in the root directory. The variable should be a JSON array of objects with the keys `url` and `name`.

Example:
```
VITE_COLLABJAM_SERVERS='[
  {"url": "ws://localhost:3333/", "name": "Local"},
  {"url": "https://your.server/", "name": "SERVER 1"},
  {"url": "https://192.0.0.1/", "name": "SERVER 2"}
]'
```


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run format
```
